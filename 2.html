    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing
    the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
    or XML(including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).</p>
    <p>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
    JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
    content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p> <p>This separation can improve
    content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
    specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
    to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
    enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
    pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
